        <h1 align="center">hello, you!</h1><br>
          <p><br>My name is Morgan. I'm a writer and aspiring full-stack developer, happy to be back living in my native city of Denver.
            Lately I spend all of my time in the <a href="http://turing.io">dungeon</a>, learning how to Ruby.
            I love anything escapist, metalsmithing (ask me why copper is my favorite metal!),
            the Rocky Mountains, and a little Australian Shepherd named Magic who cries loudly every time she sees me.
            I spend a lot of time thinking about how data, transparency and dissemination of information can change the shape of the world.
            I believe that healthcare access is a human rights issue, and that new technologies should be the champions of better policies in that arena.
            <br><br>Just you wait. One day... I will make a blog. </p>
